# SmartBins System

SmartBins is an intelligent waste disposal system that utilizes voice commands to interact with the ChatGPT model via OpenAI's API. The system assists users in determining the correct bin for different types of waste disposal.

Features:

1. Voice Interaction: Users can ask questions about which bin to use for specific types of waste, and the system provides answers generated by ChatGPT.
2. Three Bins: The system comprises three separate bins for different types of waste:
    - General Waste: For disposing of general waste.
    - Plastic: Dedicated to plastic waste.
    - Organic Waste: For compostable materials.
3. LED Feedback: The system uses LED lights to provide visual feedback on the recommended bin. The LEDs light up corresponding to the suggested bin based on the ChatGPT response.
4. Fill Level Indicator: The LEDs also serve as a fill level indicator for each bin. Ultrasonic sensors detect the fill level and trigger the LEDs to indicate whether a bin is full or has space.

Technologies Used:

 1. OpenAI's ChatGPT API
 2. Ultrasonic Sensors
 3. LED Lights
 4. Arduino Uno
 5. Raspberry Pi

How it Works:

User provides a voice command asking about waste disposal.
The command is processed and sent to ChatGPT via the OpenAI API.
ChatGPT generates a response suggesting the appropriate bin.
The LED lights corresponding to the recommended bin light up.
Ultrasonic sensors detect the fill level of each bin and update the LED status accordingly.
SmartBins aims to simplify waste management by providing real-time guidance on waste sorting and bin filling levels through intuitive voice commands and visual feedback.
